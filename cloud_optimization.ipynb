    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The following architecture diagram illustrates a cost-optimized solution for a healthcare system. The solution encompasses various components designed to provide efficient healthcare services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Amazon EC2** instances for hosting the healthcare system's web application and services. Estimated cost: $2,000 per month.\n",
    "- **Amazon RDS** for MySQL database to store patient records and medical data securely. Estimated cost: $1,000 per month.\n",
    "- **Amazon Elastic Load Balancing** (ELB) for distributing traffic and ensuring high availability. Estimated cost: $200 per month.\n",
    "- **Amazon CloudFront** for caching static medical resources and optimizing performance. Estimated cost: $200 per month.\n",
    "- **Amazon API Gateway** for creating and managing RESTful APIs for healthcare services. Estimated cost: $200 per month.\n",
    "- **Amazon Cognito** for robust identity and access management (IAM) to safeguard patient data and authentication. Estimated cost: $200 per month.\n",
    "- **Amazon CloudWatch** for monitoring system performance and ensuring operational excellence. Estimated cost: $200 per month.\n",
    "- **Amazon Simple Notification Service** (SNS) to send critical healthcare alerts and notifications. Estimated cost: $200 per month.\n",

    "## Infrastructure Details and Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table provides an overview of estimated monthly costs for the proposed architecture:\n",

    "## Pricing Strategies for DEV, TEST, and PROD Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "To efficiently manage costs and resources, consider the following pricing strategies for various environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DEV Environment:** Develop and test the healthcare system on Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Free Tier, ensuring no additional costs during development.\n",
    "- **TEST Environment:** Host the TEST environment on Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS On-Demand pricing model to simulate realistic load conditions for testing.\n",
    "- **PROD Environment:** For production, consider using Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Reserved Instances pricing model to reduce monthly costs while maintaining consistent healthcare service.\n",

    "## Advantages of the Proposed Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed architecture offers several advantages, especially critical in healthcare:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost Savings:** The architecture leverages AWS's pay-as-you-go pricing model to provide cost optimization.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Designed to accommodate increased healthcare system usage and expanding patient data.\n",
    "- **Reliability:** Ensures high availability, data integrity, and operational excellence for efficient healthcare services.\n",
    "- **Security:** Amazon Cognito provides robust identity and access management, ensuring patient data protection and HIPAA compliance.\n",
